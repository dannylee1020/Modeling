# Modeling

## Motivation
building and optimizing predictive models that can be used to create values in business settings. Research environment in a notebook and going through the process of data cleaning, feature engineering, algorithm selecting to building and optimizing model is the first necessary step in the entire machine learning pipeline to answer some of the important business questions

## Project Overview
the goal of this project is to research and build models for different types of problems where machine learning is used extensively. These include but not limited to: classification, regression, NLP, time series, anomaly detection etc. and algorithms used include: Neural Network, Tree based models, Boosting, etc.
